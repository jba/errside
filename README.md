# Errors as Side Notes

If Java-style catch blocks are like footnotes in a book, then Go error-handling
statements are like parenthenticals. Both are annoying. The first takes you too
far away to read the extra material, while the second distracts from the main
text.

Side notes are a great alternative: the extra material is just an eye-shift
away, but you can easily ignore it if you want to.

This package displays Go error-handling statements on the side, by indenting
them to the right. It also moves assignments to error variables to the right,
by introducing an alternative assignment syntax (for display only).
